# orblit-net

Multiplayer for [Orblit](https://github.com/ChxisB/orblit).

Replication reads component *columns* straight out of the engine, rather than
walking entities and asking each one what changed. So capturing five hundred
transforms is a handful of bulk copies rather than five hundred lookups. That
is the engine's storage decision paying for itself a second time.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ChxisB/orblit.git       # beside this one
./tool/link_local.sh                                   # point at that checkout
./tool/check.sh
```

## What it does

- **Snapshots and deltas.** Deltas are built against the tick a client
  acknowledged, not the last thing sent. So a dropped message costs one larger
  snapshot, rather than a world that quietly drifts apart.
- **Ownership.** A client proposes and the authority decides. Only components
  declared owner-writable, and only on entities it agrees that client owns.
  Every refusal is counted rather than thrown away.
- **Interpolation.** Renders a little behind, so remote entities move rather
  than jump. Floats blend, and integers take the earlier value.
- **Transports.** A loopback link, so a single-player build runs the real
  networked path, and a socket transport for actual play.
- **Timing.** A `TickClock` keeps the tick rate and reports drift. After each
  `publish`, `host.summary()` says where the tick went, phase by phase, and
  how many bytes each client was sent for each component.

```dart
final host = NetHost(
  world: world,
  set: set,
  networkId: networkId,
  clock: TickClock(period: const Duration(milliseconds: 50)),
  onOverrun: (summary) => print(summary.tickMax),
);
host.phase('physics', stepPhysics);
host.publish();
print(host.summary().phases['encode']?.average);
```
